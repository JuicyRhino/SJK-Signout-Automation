# SJK-Signout-Automation
**This is the jankiest possible solution to automate data collection form the tech sign out program at SJK. This is done in Apple Automator, each module is (shocking) it's own Applescript module in Automator, though this could probably all be done in one module. It takes the outstanding loaner data from SJK Signout and deposits it into a Google Sheets page. The user must then format the data.
